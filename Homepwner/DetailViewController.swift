//This class will conform to the UITextFieldDelegate, UINavigationControllerDelegate, UIImagePickerControllerDelegate.
//Will have a UIImageView to store a thumbnail of the video, a videoFileName,
//conform to the UITextFieldDelegate protocol to dismiss the keyboard when return key is pressed
//Will take a picture for the Gallery if the camera is available. Will take a video for the Gallery if the camera is available. Will have the app access the Photo Library if the camera is not available.
//Will get the selected video and Save video to the main photo album and puts that image on the screen in the image view.
//Will turn the video into a thumbnail save a video to the photos library. Will add a property observer to the itemproperty that updates the title of the navigationItem. Will dismiss the keyboard when return key is pressed. Will let the user dismiss the keyboard by touching any part of the background DetailsView - keyboard doesnt show up in the simulator.
//This will allow the values in the items viewTable to be updated when user taps Back button The text of the text fields to the corresponding item properties will be set to the values in the function
